DESCRIPTION:
-------------
Implements the following functionality in BF3:
Sprint Toggle
Automatically "Spot" enemies when firing at them

INSTALL:
-------------
If you have AutoHotkey installed, simply double-click bf3_sprint_toggle.ahk to run the script.
Otherwise, run the bf3_sprint_toggle.exe file.

The script will continue to run in the windows taskbar until manually closed.

USAGE:
-------------
Edit the bf3_sprint_toggle-config.ini.ini file to enable/disable script functionality and map your keybindings.

ScriptToggle: enable/disable the entire script
SprintToggle: while holding FORWARD, press the SPRINT key to start sprinting. You will stop sprinting if: FORWARD is released, SPRINT is pressed, Crouch is toggled

NOTES:
-------------
bf3_sprint_toggle-config.ini:
 - The [Hotkeys] section refers to key configuration for use by this script only
 - The [Keybinds] section is where you tell the script what your INGAME keybinds are; make sure these match your setup

CHANGELOG:
-------------
1.0: initial release
